# stary
A modern and slick look for the Minecraft UI. Directly stripped from [LiquidBounce/legacy](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/tree/legacy) + some tweaks.

## Features
- An animated shader present on the main menu (and other screens while not in a world).
- Particles are rendered everywhere `GuiScreen#drawClientBackground()` is called (even in inventory).
- All buttons have a slick and modern look to them.
- The font [Roboto-Medium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) is used for rendering the UI text.
- Tried to eliminate all occurrences of a "dirt" background.
